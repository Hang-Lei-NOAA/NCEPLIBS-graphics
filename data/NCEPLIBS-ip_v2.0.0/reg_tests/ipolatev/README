Test the ipolatev suite of routines to interpolate a global lat/lon
grid of u/v wind (with bitmap) to several grids of
various map projections.  All available interpolation methods -
neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, spectral, budget, budget-neighbor -
are invoked.

These routines have threads, so this regression test is run twice -
with 1 and 4 threads.

The input u/v wind data is located in the ./data subdirectory.
It is in grib1 format.

This wind data is interpolated to the following grids:

grid #       description
======       ===========
003          one-degree global lat/lon (ncep grid 3)
008          mercator (ncep grid 8)
127          t254 gaussian (ncep grid 127)
203          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
205          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
212          nh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
218          lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The control and test programs are compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  Before compiling, see the script
comments for more information.  Program executables will hosted in the
./exec/ctl and ./exec/test directories.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' on zeus with the
runzeus.1.thread.ksh or runzeus.4.threads.ksh for 1/4 threads.
On ccs, use runccs.1.thread.ksh or runccs.4.threads.ksh
These scripts are in the ./scripts subdirectory.

The control and test programs output the interpolated u/v wind data to
direct access files.  These may be viewed in Grads with the ".ctl" files in
the ./grads subdirectory.  There is one ".ctl" file for each grid number.
