Test iplib routine ipmerge2, which merges two bitmapped fields
into one.  I am not sure this routine is even used anymore.

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
