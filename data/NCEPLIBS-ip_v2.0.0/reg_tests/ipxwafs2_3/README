Test ip routines ipxwafs2 and ipxwafs3 by transforming a global grid of
600 mb temperature (on ncep grid 3) to wafs grids 37 thru 44 using copygb.
A similar transform is done by gfs job JGFS_WAFS.sms.prod.

After the global to wafs grid transforms are completed, copygb is
invoked again to interpolate files of 600 mb temperature on each wafs grid
back to ncep grid 3.

Note: routine ipxwafs2 is invoked for interpolation option '0' (bilinear)
and routine ipxwafs3 is invoked for interpolation option '2' (neighbor)
also, routine ipxwaf is invoked as well.  However, only part of the
routine is used, so a separate regression test for ipxwafs is
required.

The input data for these tests is located in the ./data subdirectory.
It is in grib 1 format.

This regression uses the copygb source code that is part of the 
copygb regression test (located in the /copygb/src subdirectory).
See the README file in the copygb subdirectory for more details.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
