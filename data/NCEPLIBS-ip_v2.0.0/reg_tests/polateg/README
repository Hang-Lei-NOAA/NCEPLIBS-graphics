Regression test for the polateg series of routines.

Interpolate temperature data on a 1-degree global lat/lon grid
to a high-res lat/lon grid, returning their vector gradients.
The input temperature data is located in the ./data subdirectory.

Note: there are bugs in polateg0 and polateg1.  The calls to gdswzd are missing the argument
for grid box area. This is documented in subversion ticket #1. This is causing the 
regression test to core dump.  The polateg4 routine seems to be working.

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The 'control' and 'test' programs are compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  Before compiling, see the script
comments for more information.  Program executables will hosted in the
./exec/ctl and ./exec/test directories.

The programs output the interpolated gradient data to direct access binary files.
These files may be viewed in Grads using the ".ctl" files in the grads
subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
