Invoke copygb to interpolate a global lat/lon grid of vegetation
greenness to numerous ncep standard grids.  Use all interpolation
options: 0-bilinear, 1-bicubic, 2-neighbor, 3-budget, 4-spectral,
6-neighbor-budget.

The ncep standard grid numbers are defined in the official
ncep grib documentation.
 
The input data is: /nwprod/fix/global_shdmax.0.144x0.144.grb

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information.

The regression test is run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

This is considered a 'supplemental' regression test and it not
run as part of the full suite of tests from the "Runall"
driver script.

Note, the copygb executable in this directory is used as part of
the ipxwafs2_3 regression test.
