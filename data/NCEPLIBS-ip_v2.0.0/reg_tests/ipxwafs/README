Test ip routine ipxwafs by transforming a global grid of
scalars (on ncep grid 3) to wafs grids 37 thru 44 using a specially
modified version of copygb.

After the global to wafs grid transforms are completed, copygb is
invoked again to interpolate a grid of scalars on each 
wafs grid back to ncep grid 3.

These input datasets (field of 600 mb temperature), are located
in the ./data subdirectory of THE IPXWAFS2_3 REGRESSION test.

Note: routine ipxwafs and ipxwafs2 are the same except the latter
accounts for bitmaps.  The ops version of copygb uses the latter
routine for all interpolation options except '2' (neighbor).
The specially modified version calls ipxwafs instead.  Since the
test datasets does not have bitmaps (a field of 600 mb temperatures)
the specially modified copygb and ops copygb give the same answer.

The special copygb source code is in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information before compiling.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
